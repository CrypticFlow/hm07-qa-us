# Sprint 7 Project: Writing our own test scripts.

In this project we get hands on experience writing our own test scripts in javascript for our Urban Grocers Api. This project combines all of our knowledge on how to call api's using endpoints, query the {API_URL}/docs/ (Api Docs) database, write our own scripts for testing, and run them using the terminal. We also gained experience with cloning from Github to our local computer, using Git, making commits, and pushing back to our Github.
We're using VS Code as our editor (because it's the best), Node.js and Jest (a testing dependency built on Node) to run our scripts in the terminal, and Git and Github for our commits and version control.
Techniques used include GET, POST, PUT, & DELETE methods for calling our api endpoints using async await higher order functions inside of our test functions. Once the script is correct, we use npx jest {METHODHandler.test.js} terminal commands to run our test scripts.
This project is challenging, yet fun a rewarding.
